Hi! I'm Tamim — working as a Systems Engineer in Structural Health Monitoring and Servo solutions. My job involves writing software for Servo Test Applications (using LabVIEW) used by more than 200 Structural engineering laborataries and universities around the world to test buildings and structures and make them more safe against Earthquakes.

I was recently promoted to manage all international projects, communicate and undestand customer requirements, design custom solutions and systems to cater to their requirements and provide technical support to existing and all new customers. 

I missed coding and I've recently been diving deeper into programming — spending some time learning the fundamentals, building small projects, and I have been really enjoying it.

I like writing things down as I learn — it helps me understand and remember stuff better and makes it easy for me to go back and review things quickly. That’s what this page is about: a place to collect my thoughts, notes, and experiments as I go.

### 🧠 Things I like (at the time of writing):
- ⚽ Playing and watching football  
- 💻 Learning about Scheme & Functional Programming 
- 🧱 Backend development with Java & Spring Boot  
- 🏋️ My sacred gym sessions  
- 🌱 Planning for a full-time career in software

Thanks for stopping by — feel free to contact me, leave a comment or give your valuable feedback.
