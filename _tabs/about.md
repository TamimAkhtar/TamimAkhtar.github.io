## 👋 About Me

Hey! I'm **Tamim** — a Systems Engineer with a degree in **Mechanical Engineering**. These days, a big part of my job involves writing software for **Servo Test Applications**, mostly using **LabVIEW** and sometimes **MATLAB**.

I've recently been diving deeper into programming — spending some time learning the fundamentals, building small projects, and just getting better at it.

I really enjoy **writing things down** as I learn — it helps me understand and remember stuff better and makes it easy for me to go back and review things quickly. That’s what this blog is about: a place to collect my thoughts, notes, and experiments as I go.

### 🧠 Things I like doing (at the time of writing):
- ⚽ Playing football  
- 💻 Learning Scheme & Functional Programming  
- 🧱 Backend development with Java & Spring Boot  
- 🏋️ Gym Workouts  
- 🌱 Daydreaming about being a full-time software engineer  

Thanks for stopping by — feel free to explore!
