This site is based on the Chirpy Jekyll theme and can be found at [Cotes Chung repository](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy.git).

**Adding Notes and Project Section**
1. Created _notes/ and _projects/ folders (just like _posts/) to store note and project markdown files.

2. Added a new file notes.md (and projects.md) in the _tabs/ folder with the following front matter:

'''
---
title: Notes
icon: fas fa-stream
order: 5
layout: category
category: notes
---

'''
